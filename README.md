# 👋 Hi, I'm Joseph Tran

I'm a third-year Informatics student at the University of Washington, focusing on **Software Development** and **Data Science**. I love building tools that make information more accessible and intuitive—whether it's through web apps, well-structured databases, or smart automation.

## 💻 What I’m Working On

- **Mobius** — Full-stack education platform for private academies.

## 🧠 Interests

- Data engineering & pipelines  
- Full-stack development (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL)  
- Storytelling through personal journaling & visual design  

## 📚 Currently Learning

- Strudel
- PostgreSQL optimization and indexing 
- Cloud deployment via Render & Azure 

## 🌱 Outside of Tech

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:
-  Trying new cooking recepies
-  Reading (currently: *On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous*)  
- ☕ café hopping!
